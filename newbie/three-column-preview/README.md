## What I learned

This challenge was simpler than some of the previous ones I've attempted as the columns were pretty straightforward to build. I tried to make them as simple as possible while avoiding to repeat the css classes. Unfortunately, there's no way to make the `font-color` "inherit" each section's `bg-color`, and therefore I had to add three lines and specify each of the sections in my css. Thankfully, the variables came in handy.
