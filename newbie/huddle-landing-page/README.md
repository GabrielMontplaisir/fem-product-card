## What I learned

Implemented some [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons. Instead of applying my own CSS styles to the border, I decided to try to override the `--fa-border-<style>` defaults. This worked well. However, you quickly realize that the icons aren't all the same size. I then tried to apply the `fa-fw` class, which gives a constant width to all icons, but it doesnÂ´t play well with the `fa-border` class. Instead, I set a constant `width: 2.125rem` (around 34px) and this fixed the border issues.

I was having trouble having everything blend nicely at certain widths (from 860px to 1200px mostly). I was trying to avoid having the image scale to 100%, but I also didn't want to limit the desktop version. I ended up creating two separate media queries, and then setting everything in a grid and adjusting the font-sizes to be quasi-pixel perfect with my dimensions. I'm sure there's a better way to do this, but I haven't practiced my HTML + CSS in a while, so I may leave it for later.
