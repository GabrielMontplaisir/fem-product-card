## What I learned

The biggest hurdle for this challenge was the creation of the overlay for the NFT image. Many resources I found online to duplicate this effect had me create 5 different divs and have 20 different CSS properties (I wish I was exxagerating at times), and I couldn't believe it was that complex. I was determined to find a simpler alternative. And of course, it was as simple as creating yet another flexbox. Anyways, lesson learned, and now it's part of my arsenal!
