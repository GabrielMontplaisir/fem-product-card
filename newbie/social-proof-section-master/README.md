## What I learned

I opted to design this webpage with a mobile-first workflow. I feel like it was more work in the long run, but it worked out.

Learned that `letter-spacing` can have negative values to bring the letters much closer together.

I played a lot with the concept of `max-width` for mobile as I didn't like the `max-width` for the background for the rating on medium screen sizes (between 500px & 1100px particularly).

I feel like I heavily relied on flexbox for this challenge, and I'm not sure that was the best way to approach it. I am wondering if there's another way to approach this challenge that would be easier. Or perhaps more traditional HTML?
