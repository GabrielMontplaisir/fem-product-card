## What I learned

For a "newbie" project, I feel like this is the most complex project I've undertaken thus far.

I really wanted to take advantage of implementing the data.json file provided by FEM and use it in the project instead of hard-coding the data in the HTML. At first, I was going to use some vanilla JS with some Jquery to get it done. Then, I was thinking of using the JS `FetchAPI()` to get the JSON data and add it to my HTML. This too proved to be a little more complex than anticipated. After considerable research, it almost felt simpler to use a JS framework. And honestly, I'm glad I did. I used VueJS, and it was easier than I thought.

Lastly, I noticed that the project also came with some variable fonts. I wanted to try it out (it was overkill as this project didnÂ´t need variable fonts), to learn how to use it a little bit.

For everything I've learned throughout this project, read through the comments, particularly in `vite.config.js`, and everything in the `src` folder.
