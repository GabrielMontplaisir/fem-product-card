## What I learned

I feel like I learned less for this challenge than my previous one. However, I did make things easier on myself by reusing pieces that I've built previously. As a result, this challenge took me a few hours as opposed to the initial few days that the Product Preview Component Card did.

## Continued development

## Useful resources

- [My own Product Preview Card Component](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/product-preview-card-component-90sBljPQFV) -- May seem like a bit of a copout, but I used a lot of the components from the Product Preview Component Card. I feel like this project was simpler than the previous one, and I could simply reuse the work I previously did and adapt it to my needs.
