## What I learned

This challenge worked very well and was quite easy. I used `clamp()` to auto-size my font appropriately, and then used `order` with my flexbox to move the cards around to get a nice 2x2 square at medium screen sizes (around 768px), and then to the appropriate spot again around 1140px.
