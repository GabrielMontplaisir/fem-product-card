## What I learned

Implemented some [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons. Instead of applying my own CSS styles to the border, I decided to try to override the `--fa-border-<style>` defaults. This worked well. However, you quickly realize that the icons aren't all the same size. I then tried to apply the `fa-fw` class, which gives a constant width to all icons, but it doesnÂ´t play well with the `fa-border` class. Instead, I set a constant `width: 2.125rem` (around 34px) and this fixed the border issues.

## Continued Development

**February 9, 2023**
I reworked the website a little bit to make it as responsive as possible without the bugginess from certain widths. I wanted to make sure the image didn't get too large at certain widths (particularly aroung 768px to 1200px), so added a second media query to have a maximum width on the image. I then added a `max-width: 100%` to allow the image to grow, and added `width: 50%` so it would stay within the screen space. I would love to know if there's an easy way to accomplish it without relying on grid. I also made the social media icons slightly larger to accommodate the larger screen sizes.

For a while, I was trying to avoid using `grid` in the `body` in favour of margin and padding. However, using `grid` with `place-content: center` provides a different, but more accurate width of the content than using `margin-inline: auto`. I resolved myself to using it.
