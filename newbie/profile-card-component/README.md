## What I learned

Setting `position: absolute` on the circle images (For the avatar picture & background circles) and `transform: transition()` them to the appropriate spot did the trick. However, I'm having a hard time to match them in their mobile version. I have a feeling it may be fixed using `clamp()`, but would have to play with it some more.
