## What I learned

This is my first challenge I tackled w/ a form. I really wanted to make this semantically accurate, so opted to use the use the `<input>` element w/ radio buttons and took advantage of `value`, `name`, `id` and `label`. Unlike previous challenges where buttons were purely aesthetic, this button actually served a purpose. I initially wrapped the inputs and buttons in a `<form>`, but noticed it refreshed my page, so removed it.

Finally, I added my `<script>` at the end of my page before the `</body>` because this isn't the type of page which requires heavy JS.

Next, I took advantage of `transition` in my CSS to animate the buttons a little bit, and also took advantage of the `::before` to display the ratings. I also used `:checked` to highlight the selection. Because of the Javascript, I had to use `id`, which isnÂ´t something I often have to do when building static websites. It was a nice change of pace.

Having considerable experience w/ JS, it wasn't too difficult for me to figure out how to go about going from one section to the next. I opted for an `Eventlistener` to wait for the `"click"` and attributed the radio button's value to my selection. For a little extra, I decided to add a prompt if no selection is made to indicate to the user that they didn't select a rating. I simply hid the `.hidden` class where necessary. Because `InnerHTML` should be avoided where possible, I opted to use `innerText` instead.
