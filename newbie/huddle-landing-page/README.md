## What I learned

Implemented some [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons. Instead of applying my own CSS styles to the border, I decided to try to override the `--fa-border-<style>` defaults. This worked well. However, you quickly realize that the icons aren't all the same size. I then tried to apply the `fa-fw` class, which gives a constant width to all icons, but it doesnÂ´t play well with the `fa-border` class. Instead, I set a constant `width: 2.125rem` (around 34px) and this fixed the border issues.
