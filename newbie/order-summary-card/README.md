## What I learned

I've learned that my monitors donÂ´t always display colours properly. I designed 99% of the card until I realized there was a border-radius around the plan details... At least I caught it before I submitted the solution.

This card felt a little easier in design than the NFT. Nonetheless, this one was fun because of the colours. I was also pretty afraid I was going to have to play with css styles to design the wavey background. Thankfully, they provided us with the svg.

As I usually work on my PC, I often design my projects with the desktop version in mind first. However, it became evident that the mobile version had a lot of changes. For that reason, I felt it was easier to "scale up" than to scale-down. I didn't have to play too much with the values. I simply copy/pasted the necessary desktop values into the media query.
