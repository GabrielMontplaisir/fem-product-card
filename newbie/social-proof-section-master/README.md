## What I learned

I opted to design this webpage with a mobile-first workflow. I feel like it was more work in the long run, but it worked out. I feel like the desktop design is "very" different than the design. May have to play with it some more.

Learned that `letter-spacing` can have negative values to bring the letters much closer together.

Played a lot with the concept of `max-width` for mobile as I didn't like the max-width for the background for the rating. Learned how to create figures / blockquotes.

Really had to play with flexboxes for this challenge. I really enjoy Flexbox as a tool, but I feel like I'm relying on it too much. Wondering if there's another way to approach this challenge which would be easier w/ Gridbox for example. Or perhaps more traditional HTML?
